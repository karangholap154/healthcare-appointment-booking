## üöß Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. **Complex State Management Across Components**
**Challenge**: Managing shared state between doctor listings, individual profiles, and appointment booking while maintaining data consistency.

**Solution**: Implemented React Context API with a centralized AppContext that provides doctors data, appointments, and search functionality to all components. This eliminated prop drilling and ensured single source of truth for application state.

```typescript
// Created a comprehensive context with proper TypeScript interfaces
interface AppContextType {
  doctors: Doctor[];
  appointments: Appointment[];
  addAppointment: (appointment: Omit<Appointment, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'status'>) => void;
  searchTerm: string;
  setSearchTerm: (term: string) => void;
}
```

### 2. **TypeScript Integration with Complex Data Structures**
**Challenge**: Defining comprehensive type interfaces for doctors with nested objects (availability, schedules) and ensuring type safety across all components.

**Solution**: Created detailed TypeScript interfaces in a dedicated types file, including union types for availability status and proper typing for nested objects like schedules and availability.

```typescript
// Comprehensive typing for complex nested structures
interface Doctor {
  availability: {
    status: 'available' | 'busy' | 'on-leave';
    nextAvailable?: string;
  };
  schedule: {
    [key: string]: string[];
  };
}
```
